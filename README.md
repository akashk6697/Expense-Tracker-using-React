# Expense Tracker using React

 This is an interesting app idea to learn React.js where I build a complete Expense Tracker using React Hooks & Context API. At the bare minimum, this app should allow users to add expenses, categories them, and show some insights like how much expenses went towards food, education, entertainment, bills, travel, etc.
 It uses functional components with hooks and the context API.

## Usage
```
npm install

# Run on http://localhost:3000
npm start

# Build for prod
npm run build
```
